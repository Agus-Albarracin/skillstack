# Respect Authorization and Remote Boundaries

Treat planning, staging, committing, and remote operations as separate permissions.

- Inspect and propose a commit plan when asked to review or plan changes.
- Before requesting authorization for a commit, print the proposal in the console: exact subject, concise description, included paths (and explicit exclusions when relevant), and checks already run. Then request approval in the conversation and wait for it before staging or committing.
- Stage and create local commits only when the user explicitly asks to commit or clearly authorizes the operation.
- Do not push, pull, fetch, open a pull request, merge, rebase, tag, amend, or change remotes unless separately requested.
- Do not alter Git identity or repository configuration without explicit approval.
- Stop before a destructive or history-rewriting operation and request authorization.

An instruction to make atomic commits authorizes local commits for in-scope changes only. It does not authorize including pre-existing user changes unless the user assigns them to the commit.
